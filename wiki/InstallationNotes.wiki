  * Under the Pages menu, click Add New Page. Enter "Add Booking" as the title. Click on "Change Permalinks". Select "Post name" as the default permalink format. If you require a different format on your site, you will need to correct the permalinks on the Settings page.

  * The content can be left blank. Visibility should remain public; no parent specified, and template can be left as "Default Template". Click publish. Now edit the permalink so it reads "edit-booking". Click update.

  * Now if you go back to the main site, there should be a new page "Add Booking" available from the menu bar. Clicking on it will bring up the Add Booking page.
